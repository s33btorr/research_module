# DEFINITIONS OF NAIVE
## PAPER DEFINITIONS
### Homogeneous Distorsions
1. Credit: "naive present-biased borrowers underestimate their willingness to pay costly interest on a loan."
2. Add-Ons: "firms charge a high price for a service naive consumers use unexpectedly often, and this induces consumers to undertake socially inefficient ex ante steps to avoid the service."
3. In other markets: 
    - Exacerbation of unexpected spending: "casino may provide alcohol below cost and create an overly glittery environment to encourage naive consumers to gamble more."
    - Unexpected add-ons payed often can cause distortions: "A traveler who flies with Ryanair, for instance, might be stressed thinking about whether she will manage to avoid all fees."
### Sophisticated-Side Distortions
1. Add-ons 2: "both naive and sophisticated consumers expect to take costly steps to avoid an expensive add-on, but naive consumers fail to do so." (Mobile phone overage charges, bank account overdraft fees and hotel add-ons)
2. Other: "overconfidence about memory".
### Naive-Side Distorsions
1. Useless Extras: "Suppose firms sell a basic product (new car) and once a consumer arrives, the firm can offer optional extras—such as rust proofing, paint and fabric protection, and prepaid maintenance—that generate no value for consumers.30 Sophisticated consumers understand that the extras are useless, but naive consumers do not."
2. Other: 
    - "insurance market in which a naive consumer is unable to read all the details of her health insurance contract and assumes that she is getting full coverage."
    - "naive consumers are unaware of add-on prices". (example: all-inclusive package)


## OTHER DEFINITIONS

## OUR DEFINITIONS

Sergio: naïvete happens when people don’t (fully) understand or predict their own actions, they have a hard time controlling themselves or they’re slow to figure something out. This includes every subject behavioral economics has focused on, such as lack of attention, time preferences (the sophisticated agent never procrastinates is a quote i would personally tatoo on myself lol), overconfidence, impulse (as opposite of prudence), myopy, … It differs from rationality because that means you’re good at predicting how things work in the world, around you. Naïvete is more about how you see yourself imo: you’re not able to understand your own lack of self-control, even if you have rational expectations.

Cansu: naivité is included in the irrationality. It arises when the belief about one’s behavior/action/preference do not correspond to their ex-post behavior/action/preference. They have an incorrect belief. The discrepancy may be due to different reasons (inattention, overconfidence, not being aware of themselves or the market etc.). These are mistakes, and their behavior is inconsistent with that of utility-maximizing agent. I would say that sophisticated agent is not the one that never procrastinates but the one who realizes that they may procrastinate and act accordingly (which usually means they don’t procrastinate ofc). A sophisticated agent may have biases, but they are aware of that. Here I have a difficulty separating rational and sophisticated because a sophisticated agent will make the rational decisions at the end.
