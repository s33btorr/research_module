# DEFINITIONS OF NAIVE
## PAPER DEFINITIONS
### Homogeneous Distorsions
1. Credit: "naive present-biased borrowers underestimate their willingness to pay costly interest on a loan."
2. Add-Ons: "firms charge a high price for a service naive consumers use unexpectedly often, and this induces consumers to undertake socially inefficient ex ante steps to avoid the service."
3. In other markets: 
    - Exacerbation of unexpected spending: "casino may provide alcohol below cost and create an overly glittery environment to encourage naive consumers to gamble more."
    - Unexpected add-ons paid often can cause distortions: "A traveler who flies with Ryanair, for instance, might be stressed thinking about whether she will manage to avoid all fees."
### Sophisticated-Side Distortions
1. Add-ons 2: "both naive and sophisticated consumers expect to take costly steps to avoid an expensive add-on, but naive consumers fail to do so." (Mobile phone overage charges, bank account overdraft fees and hotel add-ons)
2. Other: "overconfidence about memory".
### Naive-Side Distorsions
1. Useless Extras: "Suppose firms sell a basic product (new car) and once a consumer arrives, the firm can offer optional extras — such as rust proofing, paint and fabric protection, and prepaid maintenance — that generate no value for consumers. Sophisticated consumers understand that the extras are useless, but naive consumers do not."
2. Other: 
    - "insurance market in which a naive consumer is unable to read all the details of her health insurance contract and assumes that she is getting full coverage."
    - "naive consumers are unaware of add-on prices". (example: all-inclusive package)


## OTHER DEFINITIONS
From Eliaz, Kfir, and Spiegler, Ran “Contracting with Diversely Naive Agents" (2006):
"In our model, the agent has dynamically inconsistent preferences. Agent types differ only in their degree of “sophistication”, that is, their ability to forecast the change in their future tastes. We fully characterize the menu of contracts which the principal offers in order to screen the agent's sophistication. The menu does not exclude any type: it provides a perfect commitment device for relatively sophisticated types, and “exploitative” contracts which involve speculation with relatively naive types. More naive types are more heavily exploited and generate a greater profit for the principal. Our results allow us to interpret real-life contractual arrangements in a variety of industries."

## OUR DEFINITIONS

Sergio: naïvete happens when people don’t (fully) understand or predict their own actions, they have a hard time controlling themselves or they’re slow to figure something out. This includes every subject behavioral economics has focused on, such as lack of attention, time preferences, overconfidence, impulse (as opposite of prudence), myopy, … It differs from rationality because that means you’re good at predicting how things work in the world, around you. Naïvete is more about how you see yourself in my opinion: you’re not able to understand your own lack of self-control, even if you have rational expectations.

Cansu: naïvete is included in the irrationality. It arises when the belief about one’s behavior/action/preference do not correspond to their ex-post behavior/action/preference. They have an incorrect belief. The discrepancy may be due to different reasons (inattention, overconfidence, not being aware of themselves or the market etc.). These are mistakes, and their behavior is inconsistent with that of utility-maximizing agent. I would say that sophisticated agent is not the one that never procrastinates but the one who realizes that they may procrastinate and act accordingly (which usually means they don’t procrastinate ofc). A sophisticated agent may have biases, but they are aware of that. Here I have a difficulty separating rational and sophisticated because a sophisticated agent will make the rational decisions at the end.
