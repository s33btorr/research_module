### General Ideas:
- We should understand papers used on our selected paper (add them to Excel table).
- We could find an assumption we do not agree on and what happens without it (very valuable).
- Paper was finished in 2017, we could think: Has the model aged well?
    - Strong opinions about the technology getting target.
    - Does the model captures these possible changes?

### What is a naive consumer?
Do we agree with the term described? If not, does the changes in this new definition has substancial impact on welfare? Does this changes results of the model?

- Is it a matter of the degree of naive?
    - Continuous vs. binary
- What does a naive consumer does and in this specific case, is it well define?
    - Making mistakes vs. other types of naives

### How should our paper look like?
- Only proof what is important for us.
- Personal summary of the selected paper.
- They should be no need to go back to selected (original) paper for understanding ours.
