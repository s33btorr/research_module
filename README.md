# Our paper selected: NAIVETE-BASED DISCRIMINATION
Authors: PAUL HEIDHUES AND BOTOND KOSZEGI

## Meeting 20-Nov
### General Ideas:
- We should understand papers used on our selected paper (add them to Excel table).
- We could find an assumption we do not agree on and what happens without it (very valuable).
- Paper was finished in 2017, we could think: Has the model aged well?
    - Strong opinions about the technology getting target.
    - Does the model captures these possible changes?

### What is a naive consumer?
Do we agree with the term described? If not, does the changes in this new definition has substancial impact on welfare? Does this changes results of the model?

- Is it a matter of the degree of naive?
    - Continuous vs. binary
- What does a naive consumer does and in this specific case, is it well define?
    - Making mistakes vs. other types of naives

### How should our paper look like?
- Only proof what is important for us.
- Personal summary of the selected paper.
- They should be no need to go back to selected (original) paper for understanding ours.

## Meeting 29-Nov
In general we decided on having two ideas for a critic:
1. Definition of naivete we do not agree on. Maybe on a specific scenario we could show why our definition is better.
2. Distribution vs. Welfare: Paper focus on welfare, is it the only important thing? Maybe there is a scenario where welfare is lower but distribution is better, or the other way around.

### Answer to some questions:
- What does it mean to ***"bear the distortion"***?: Whose utility decreased (compared with situation without additional price).
- Firms have incomplete information and consumers cannot self-select given the naive behavior.
- In class we saw ***exploitation vs. participation distortion*** (in the book that Cansu found). The paper focuses on the former one. There is a charge that the consumer does not know about.
